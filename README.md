# Stopwatch App

An svelte clone for online-stopwatch.com developed just for the pourpose for learning svelte and because i need something that doesn't require ads to run.

## ToDo

- Refactor the important things into components
- Code review because everything was "vibe coded" with cline and claude
- Json parser clone?
- Code/text diff clone?

## Notes

In the future this repo will contain my tools used for DAT working, for now is just an stopwatch in the future maybe some other tools like a json parser/validator, code/text diff clone and word count all with the twist that everything will be run client side and the project could run inside a docker container or self-hosted on a computer to avoid data leaks that could break TOS on the DAT platform.
